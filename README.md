# StickTyper

StickTyper is an interactive typing game aimed at improving typing speed and accuracy. The game provides a set of words to type, and the player needs to type them as fast as possible without making mistakes. The game keeps track of typing events, manages word queues, and provides an efficient way to handle game logic.

## Features

- **Typing Challenge**: Words are presented to the player, who must type them as quickly as possible.
- **Word Queue System**: Words are displayed in sequence, and the game dynamically manages the queue to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The player receives instant feedback, both visually (hearts) and through text input.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop users.
- **Docker Support**: The project can be easily run in a Docker container for consistent setup and deployment.
